## Summary

At halfway through 2017, we are approaching the 10 year anniversary of the first forays into focus on Diversity and Inclusion in the tech industry. The industry has spent over $500M on Diversity and Inclusion efforts with little to no improvements to show for it. Diversity numbers remain stagnant, we see little to no representation of URMs at the executive or board level, reports of harassment at various tech companies continue to trickle out, and VC money for women of color founders might as well be non-existent. For any project in business, that kind of spend with such low ROI indicates a major failure in the project. Because we are in tech, when we have a major failure, a post-mortem follows shortly thereafter.

## Impact

Impact too great to be accurately quantified. 

## Root Causes

Cascading failure due to the following:
- bias
- reliance on pattern matching
- cargo-culting
- gatekeeping
- harassment


## Detection

Tracy Chou started tracking Women in engineering in 2013, with company diversity reports soon to follow. A pattern of poor results soon appeared.


## Lessons Learned

### What went well

* Implementation of monitoring of Diversity numbers quickly alerted us to a low presence of all intersections of URMs and Women. 


### What went wrong

* We have not defined what good outcomes look like.
* We have not created any methods of accountability.
* We're not measuring and reporting indicators of Inclusion like retention, promotions, and pay equity.
* We're not monitoring across all groups and intersections, to include age, veteran status, lgbtq status, and disability status.
* Too much reliance on Unconscious Bias training as a cure-all.
* Companies have not responded well to reports of harassment. (To date there have been no reports of apologies to any employees that have experienced harassment at companies.)
* We have not yet implemented safe methods for people to speak out that doesn't result in them being subjected to more harassment.

### Where we got lucky

* Numbers have stayed flat instead of dropping for women, indicating that for some reason, people still want to come to the tech industry
* Despite lack of improvement, people still want to work on this.
* Many companies have avoided Uber style public tire fires, despite being equally problematic.
